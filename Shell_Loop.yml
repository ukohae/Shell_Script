steps to configure an automated file destribution script with 2 remote servers:

step1: create two ec2 instances
follow previous videos
- Capture the private ip addresses of all your remote servers

step2: create two identical user accounts on each remote servers
$ sudo adduser Etech # make sure you give the user a password
$ sudo passwd Etech 

step3: Enable password authentication in /etc/ssh/sshd_config
caution: do not break the file

step4: restart sshd service 
$ sudo systemctl restart sshd 

step5: repeat from step3 for all your remote servers

step6: create your script and run it

step7: check the remote server to make sure your script actually move the file over

Hints; if you hit any error about sshpass then run this
  $ sudo apt install sshpass -y # to install sshpass command on your local machine

  note: run 
  $ sudo chown -R $user /tmp
