The find command:
The find command is used to search and locate the list of files and directories based on conditions you specify for files that match the arguments.
find command can be used in a variety of conditions like you can find files by permissions, users, groups, file types, date, size, and other possible criteria.
IP = Internet Protocol
what is an IP?
Ans: An IP address is a unique 32-bits number assign dynamically by a DHCP SERVER or staticly by an Admin to a 
     device on a network
$sudo find / -name "*file.yaml" --> find from root any file with extension file.yaml
$sudo find / -name etechfile.yaml  -->search all directories in your OS
$sudo find . -name etechfile.yaml   -->Find all the files whose name is etechfile.yaml in a current working directory.
$sudo find /tmp -name etechfile.yaml  -->Find all the files under /tmp directory with the name etechfile.yaml.
$sudo find $(pwd) -mtime -2         -->find and delete files that are less than 2 days younger
$sudo find /opt/backup -name text -type f -mtime +30 -delete   -->find and delete files that are more than 30 days old
$sudo find /var/log -name "*.log" -type f -mtime +30 -delete  -->find and delete files that ends with log and are less than 2 days old

$sudo find / -type d -name etechfile.yam  -->Find all directories whose name is etechfile.yaml in / directory.

Special linux commands:
$ date --> to check the date
$ cal --> to check the calendar
$uptime --> is used to check how long a system has been running
$ DO NOT RUN $ reboot

What are Linux Logs? :
Linux logs provide a timeline of events for the Linux operating system, applications and system and are a valuable troubleshooting tool when you encounter issues. 
When issues arise, analyzing log files is the first thing an administrator needs to do.
Linux log files are stored in plain-text and can be found in the /var/log directory and subdirectory. There are Linux logs for everything: 
system, kernel, package managers, boot processes, Xorg, Apache, MySQL, etc.
Log Files in Linux:
system log files:

        /var/log/kern.log --> stores Kernel logs and warning data. This log is valuable for troubleshooting custom kernels as well
         /var/log/auth.log. -->This is where you will find information about user authorization attempts; including the use of the sudo command.
sudo less /var/log/auth.log --> to inspect the content of the auth.log file.
grep memory /var/log/kern.log
sudo less /var/log/auth.log | grep user
sudo less /var/log/kern.log
sudo head /var/log/kern.log


Basic Linux Disk Management Commands :
Disk management:
/dev/sda1

Your operating system,applications, and data all need to be kept on some kind of permenent
storage so that when you turn off your computer and then ON again, your data is intack.
When you install the operating system, the disk is divided into one or more partions.
Disks: use for permenent storage
RAM(RandomAccessMemory): use for temporary storage
Swap: use for temporary storage
for example when you run a command, that command is copied from the hard disk into RAM so that
your computer processor(CPU) can access it quickly.
Linux disk management commands:
  $ df -h ---> use to check disk free space
  $ du -h ----> use to check for disk usage
  $ free -m --> use to check memory free space in megabytes
  $ free -g --->  use to check memory free space in gigabytes
  $ lscpu ---> use to check the cpu statistics
  $ ls -i ---> use to show the position of a file within the linux filesystem

Disks commands:
  #$ parted -l /dev/sda   --->use to view partions
  #$ fdisk -l /dev/sda     --->use to format a drive
Steps to mount an ebs volume to your linux server:
  $ lsblk       ----->to see the different partitions block
  $ mount      ------>use to mount a drive
  $ umount     ----->use to unmount a drive
  /mnt          ----->is the default mount directory in linux
  step1: format your drive
  $ sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/x<can be different>
  step2: make a new directory in /mnt
  $ sudo mkdir /mnt/test
  step3: mount the new volume
  $ sudo mount /dev/xvdf /mnt/test
  step4: check the actual size of the new drive
  $ df -h /mnt/xvdf   ----> h stands for human readable format
  step5: Add entry for your new drive in /etc/fstab file
  fstab( File System Table)  ---->use to permenently mount a drive to the file system
  $ sudo vi /etc/fstab
  Hit button
  i to get insertmode
  /dev/xvdf   /mnt/test  ext4  defaults  0 1    #---->is sample fstab entry
  esc  to get command mode  
  :wq! to save and quit

  steps to removed the added drive:
    step1: unmout the drive
    $ sudo umount /dev/xvdf /mnt/test

    step2: watch the video on how to detach an ebs volume

    step3: check from your server terminal that your drive was actually removed

    $ lsblk  --> make sure you don't see it
  
  ext4: is the filesystem
  defaults: means that the partition should be mounted at boot time
  number 0: tells the system not to backup files automatically from this filesystem
  number 1: tells the system to check the partition for errors after a certain number of mounts

  swap: Used for swap partitions.swap areas are used to hold data temporarily when RAM is used up.
        Data swapped to the swap area and then returned to RAM when it is needed again
  nfs: Network filesystem
  xfs: A high-performance filesystem originally developed by silicon graphics that works extremely well
       with large file.



 Network management:
 Linux Networking Commands
 Linux networking commands are used extensively to inspect, analyze, maintain, and troubleshoot the network/s connected to the system. 
 Let us first know the list of the basic networking commands used in Linux followed by a detailed explanation of each.

1. ifconfig 
2. ip
3. traceroute
5. ping
6. netstat
8. dig
9. nslookup
10. route
12. arp
13. iwconfig
14. hostname
15. curl or wget
16. mtr
17. whois
18. ifplugstatus
19. iftop
20. tcpdum

$ifconfig
Linux ifconfig stands for interface configurator. It is one of the most basic commands used in network inspection. 
ifconfig is used to initialize an interface, configure it with an IP address, and enable or disable it. 
It is also used to display the route and the network interface. 
Basic information displayed upon using ifconfig are:
IP address
MAC address
MTU(Maximum Transmission Unit) 

$ip
This is the latest and updated version of ifconfig command.
Syntax: 
$ip a 
$ip addr 
This command gives the details of all networks like ifconfig.
This command can also be used to get the details of a specific interface.
Commands to get details are:
Syntax:
$ip a show eth0  
$ip a show lo  
$ip a show wlan0

traceroute:
Linux traceroute is one of the most useful commands in networking. It is used to troubleshoot the network. It detects the delay and determines the pathway to your target. It basically helps in the following ways:

It provides the names and identifies every device on the path. 
It follows the route to the destination
It determines where the network latency comes from and reports it.
traceroute <destination>
example:
traceroute google.com
The output provides the following information:

The specified hostname
Size of the packets
The maximum number of hops required.
The IP address.

4.tracepath :
Linux tracepath is similar to traceroute command. It is used to detect network delays. However, it doesn't require root privileges.
It traces the route to the specified destination and identifies each hop in it. If your network is weak, it recognizes the point where the network is weak.
Example:   

tracepath google.com
tracepath etechconsultingllc.com
tracepath facebook.com


5.ping
Linux ping is one of the most used network troubleshooting commands. It basically checks for the network connectivity between two nodes.

ping stands for Packet INternet Groper.

The ping command sends the ICMP echo request to check the network connectivity.

It keeps executing until it is interrupted.

Use Ctrl+C Key to interrupt the execution.

Syntax:
ping <destination> 
ping googlr.com
ping -c <number> <destination>
Functions:
The command is used to measure the average response. If there is no response for the ping command, you can assume one of the following issues with the network:

There is a physical issue causing network loss.
The destination address might be dysfunctional or incorrect.
The ping request is blocked due to a target.
There might be a problem with the routing table.

6.netstat
Linux netstat command refers to the network statistics. 

It provides statistical figures about different interfaces which include open sockets, routing tables, and connection information.

Syntax:
netstat
Output:
Observe the output displaying all the open sockets.

Variations in netstat command

Below are few variations of the netstat command used.

a) To display the programs 

Syntax:
netstat -p
This displays the programs associated with the open socket.
b) To get the details of the ports

Syntax:
netstat -s
This gives detailed statistics of all the ports.

c) To get the information of the routing table 

Syntax:
netstat -r
This gives information related to the routing table.

7. dig
Linux dig command stands for Domain Information Groper. This command is used in DNS lookup to query the DNS name server. It is also used to troubleshoot DNS related issues.

8.hostname :
Linux hostname is the simple command used to view and set the hostname of a system.

9.curl & wget:
Linux curl and wget commands are used in downloading files from the internet through CLI
$curl -O <fileLink>
$ wget <fileLink> 



Process Management Commands:

Tasks run as processes 
ps command is short for ‘Process Status’. It displays the currently-running processes. However, unlike the top command, 
the output generated is not in realtime.
$ps
The terminology is as follows :
 PID = process ID
 TTY = terminal type
 TIME = total time the process has been running
 CMD = name of the command that launches the process

 To get more information using ps command use:
 $ ps -u 
 %CPU represents the amount of computing power the process is taking.
 %MEM represents the amount of memory the process is taking up.
 STAT represents process state.
 
 While ps command only displays the processes that are currently running, you can also use it to list all the processes.
 $ ps -A


  ps -ef 
  ps -ef | grep java 
  ps -ef | grep http 
  ps -ef | grep ssh 

How to Find and Kill a Zombie Process:
kill : Kill the process

$ ps aux | egrep "Z|defunct"
$ ps -o ppid= <Child PID>
$ kill -s SIGCHLD <Parent PID>
$ kill -9 <Parent PID>


top : 

Top command displays a list of processes that are running in real-time along with their memory and CPU usage.
$top
PID: Unique Process ID given to each process.
User: Username of the process owner.
PR: Priority given to a process while scheduling.
NI: ‘nice’ value of a process.
VIRT: Amount of virtual memory used by a process.
RES: Amount of physical memory used by a process.
SHR: Amount of memory shared with other processes.
S: state of the process
‘D’ = uninterruptible sleep
‘R’ = running 
‘S’ = sleeping 
‘T’ = traced or stopped 
‘Z’ = zombie
%CPU: Percentage of CPU used by the process.
%MEM; Percentage of RAM used by the process.
TIME+: Total CPU time consumed by the process.
Command: Command used to activate the process.
